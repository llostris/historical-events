# Historical Events and Graph Embedding

Code for my master's thesis project.

## Installation

Requires Python 3+

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Installing matplotlib on OSX

Sadly matplotlib is incompatibile with virutalenv, conda etc. It is required to use `venv`:

`python3 -m venv /Users/magdalenastrzoda/Virtualenvs/mgrgraphs`

If `virtualenvwrapper` is installed you can still use `workon` command to switch between environments.

## Folder structure

TBA
